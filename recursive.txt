1. This problem uses dynamic programming to break down the complexity of finding the seam of a picture into constructing the cost table and using the cost table to find the path with least cost.

2. To solve this recursively, without dynamic programming, we would recurse through  all possible path. To do so, for every square in the saliency map, we will recurse on each possible move (the one right below, left of the one right below, and right of the one below). The recursion will return the cost of the paths. Choosing the minimum cost and adding to the cost of the current square, we will have the path with the least cost from the current square.

3. For an N*N image, with recursive algorithm, there will be N * 3^N calls, or O(N*3^N).

4.We will have (50) * 3^(50)  = 3.589 *10^25 computations. It will take 3.589 * 10^16 seconds = 1.13821 *10^9 years to calculate.

5. For an N*N image, with dynamic programming, the complexity is O(N^2).

6. We will have 50^2 = 2500 computations.It will take 0.0000025 seconds.
